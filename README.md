# Computer Vision Library #

Custom computer vision library written in c++ with no dependencies. Wanted a library I could use anywhere without opencv. Some code is adapted from this amazing [course](https://github.com/pjreddie/uwimg), which was written in C.

Uses [stb_image](https://github.com/nothings/stb) single-file library for image I/O.
